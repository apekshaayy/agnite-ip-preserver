# Agnite â€” IP Protection for Creators, Made Beautiful

**Agnite** is a web-based front-end project that helps creators register their intellectual property (IP) with ease, using an intuitive, aesthetic interface.

> Built for the Creative Front-End UX Challenge BlockseBlock â€” June 2025

## Inspiration

In the creator economy, millions of artists, writers, and developers share their work online â€” but very few secure their intellectual property. Why? Because current IP tools are complex, technical, and intimidating.

**Agnite** changes that.

We imagined a space where design meets legal power â€” a smooth, beautiful interface that empowers users to protect their ideas in just a few clicks.
